Diabetes dataset
================

Notes
-----

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood\npressure, 
and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, 
as well as the response of interest, 
a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Data Set Characteristics:

:Number of Instances: 442

:Number of Attributes: First 10 columns are numeric predictive values

:Target: Column 11 is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline

:Attributes:
:Age:
:Sex:
:Body mass index:
:Average blood pressure:
:S1:
:S2:
:S3:
:S4:
:S5:
:S6:

Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the
standard deviation times `n_samples`
(i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).

Least Angle Regression software: LARS

"Least Angle Regression" ("LAR") is a new model selection
algorithm; a useful and less greedy version of traditional
forward selection methods. LAR is described in detail in a paper 
by Brad Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone and Rob Tibshirani,
soon to appear in the Annals of Statistics. 

The paper, as well as R and Splus packages, are available at
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LeastAngle_2002.pdf

A simple modification of the LAR algorithm implements Tibshirani's
Lasso, an attractive version of OLS that constrains the sum of the
absolute regression coefficients; the Lasso modification of the LARS
software calculates the entire Lasso path of coefficients for a given
problem at the cost of a single least squares fit.

A different LARS modification efficiently implements epsilon Forward
Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection
method closely related to Boosting.

Brief Description

From Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone and Robert Tibshirani (2004) "Least Angle Regression," Annals of Statistics (with discussion), 407-499, we have

"Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline."

In the tab delimited file above, the variables are named

AGE SEX BMI BP S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 Y
whereas, in the R file, they are named
age sex bmi map tc ldl hdl tch ltg glu y
In the SAS data set with quadratic variables added, the variables are
